Check If A Number Is A Palindrome
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward.

Given an integer as input, write a function that tests if it is a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: 9232
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: 12321
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: 1
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: -121
Output: false

Note
A negative number cannot be a palindrome due to the - sign

Constraints
You may not cast the number to a string
