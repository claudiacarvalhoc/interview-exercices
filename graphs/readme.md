Graphs Fundamentals

A graph is a mathematical object that consists of a set of vertices (or "nodes") and a set of edges connecting those nodes together.

We stress that you see a graph as a mathematical object that takes the form G = (V, E). A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges.

We say this because many get confused by the many ways a graph can be represented and get stuck on details. In the problem-solving process, it is of great help to "see the larger picture" and understand that a graph just consists of 2 sets (V & E).

V = {1, 2, 3}
E = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}
|V| = 3
|E| = 3


Many textbooks could be (are) dedicated to graphs, so for this we will stay brief and allow the problems of the section to instruct.

When a problem is related with:
* Entities
* Relationships
* Dependencies

We are leading with graphs!


Notes:
* When you are using graphs, do not assume connectedness, ie, that all nodes are connected
